# OpenUI

**OpenUI** is a lightweight C# library for building modern, interactive graphical user interfaces with simplicity and flexibility.

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example demonstrating how to create a window:

```cs
using OpenUI;

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var game = new GameWindow(800, 600, "Example");
        game.Show();
    }
}
```
